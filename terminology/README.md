The "Terminology" folder contains terms and vocabulary commonly taught in Algorithm and theory CS courses. It includes example files demonstrating the practical application of a term when appropriate. Most, if not all, exampe files are written in either Python or Java.

The remainder of this README document contains the terminology, along with its definition. If there's a term you would like to be added, please email **nayely.e.martinez@gmail.com**.
