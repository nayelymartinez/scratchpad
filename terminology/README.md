# Overview

The "Terminology" folder contains terms and vocabulary commonly taught in Algorithm and theory CS courses with an emphasis on Python-oriented code. It includes example files demonstrating the practical application of a term when appropriate. Most, if not all, exampe files are written in either Python or Java.

The remainder of this README document contains the terminology, along with its definition. If there's a term you would like to be added, please email **nayely.e.martinez@gmail.com**.

## Polymorphism

There are three main types of polymorphism:

1. Ad hoc polymorphism
Functions with same name can denote different implementations depending on its signature.

Python, as a dynamically typed language, does not generally require overloading functions, since you can pass in optional arguments.

1. Subtyping

Polymorphic behavior allows you to specify common methods that subclasses need on an abstract level, and then hand off to those subclasses to implement.
